# Hurdle Rush - Web3 Game: Run, Earn, Mint!

## Overview

Hurdle Rush is an innovative and exciting web3 game that promises an adrenaline-pumping experience to players who seek thrill, rewards, and uniqueness. In this game, players take on the role of a runner and navigate through a challenging obstacle course filled with hurdles. As players overcome these hurdles, they not only earn RUN tokens but also have a chance to win unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The unique aspect of this game lies in its integration with blockchain technology and Metamask, enabling players to mint their earned NFTs directly into their wallets. These NFTs become valuable assets that can be traded in marketplaces or used in other compatible web3 games, adding a new layer of interactivity and value to the gaming experience.

## How it Works

### 1. Smart Contracts

The backbone of Hurdle Rush is its smart contracts written in Solidity. These contracts handle various functionalities, such as tracking the player's progress, calculating rewards based on performance, and randomly distributing NFTs as prizes. The smart contracts are thoroughly tested using Hardhat to ensure their security and efficiency.

### 2. Web3 Integration

To play the game, users need to have MetaMask installed in their web3-enabled browsers. MetaMask acts as a bridge between the user's Ethereum wallet and the game. Players connect their wallet to the game's website, enabling seamless interactions with the smart contracts and facilitating token and NFT transactions.

### 3. Gameplay

Players start by choosing their avatar and initiating the race. Using standard keyboard controls, they guide their avatar through the challenging obstacle course. As they successfully clear hurdles, the smart contracts automatically reward them with RUN tokens, which represent their in-game earnings.

### 4. NFT Rewards

Hurdle Rush takes it up a notch by offering NFT rewards. Periodically, the smart contracts randomly select players who have cleared a certain number of hurdles and reward them with exclusive NFTs. These NFTs are minted on the blockchain and are unique, representing achievements or milestones in the game.

### 5. Minting NFTs

The winning players can mint their NFTs directly into their Metamask wallets. This process is made possible through an easy-to-use minting mechanism integrated into the game's interface. Now, players own valuable, one-of-a-kind NFTs that they can trade in dedicated marketplaces or utilize in other web3 games.

### 6. Community and Trading

Hurdle Rush fosters an active and engaging community of players who share their achievements and experiences. They can trade their earned NFTs, making the game a vibrant hub for NFT enthusiasts and collectors.
